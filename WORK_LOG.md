| December 2 | 11:30 - 11:50 am | I started off by just reading over the files in the source folder and reading the overall problem set. I want to start off by trying to convert words to an 8 bit value, but there are a few issues. Firstly, how would you know how many bits to make the file? You would need to know all unique words and then make 2 to the n bits in the upper bound of that range, with n being the amount of bits for each word. Then I needed to determine how to turn the word into value, possibly a rolling hash value similar to previous problem sets. Next time I sit down I will make a first attempt on coding this. |
