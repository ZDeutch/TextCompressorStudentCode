I want to start off by trying to convert words to an 8 bit value, but there are a few issues. Firstly, how would you know how many bits to make the file? You would need to know all unique words and then make 2 to the n bits in the upper bound of that range, with n being the amount of bits for each word. Then I needed to determine how to turn the word into value, possibly a rolling hash value similar to previous problem sets. Next time I sit down I will make a first attempt on coding this. |
| December 4  |        9:00 - 11:00 pm        | I was able to write out the skeleton of a full compress method based on what I know about hashtables and frequency arrays. The main insight that you need to first identify which characters are being used by sifting through and adding the unique characters to a seperate array. From there, you can compress the file by using fewer bits per character on average. Additionally, once you know the frequency, then the most common chars can use codes close to 0 which consume fewer bits than if they held larger codes. This makes the compression stronger but I am not exactly sure what the compression ratio for this would be. I still don't quite know how I would find the optimal bit length once I sort through the frequency and make the hashmap. For the expand method, I will need to reed in the variable encodings based on the optimal length and then using the codes backtrack to what the associated chars are. I also wonder what the worst case for an algorithm for this would be. The majority of my work time was spent reding over hashtable documentation and talking through pseudocode with gemini guided learning. |

This was just easier for me to think abouut. Other than that, I decided to move through the position rather than using the is empty file. This helped me move through the new patterns. I also found using the fact that the next code is simply the current code and the first letter of the lookahead, it becomes much easier. I think this problem was made significantly easier because we were given a TST file which meant I didn't have to worry about the iteration logic. Update Dec 13: I realized that the tester files were encoded using extended AASCII and as result I needed to use 12 bit. This got my compression ratio down to the desired 40 percent range where before I would fail tricky and have about a 60% compression ratio. This required changing the variables a little bit, but also removing some repetitive logic I had before. |
